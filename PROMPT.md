# Build the Full AIPosts Application

I want to create a **complete social app** (backend + frontend) that allows users to create, comment on, and interact with posts.  
You will build a **new Rails 8.0 API** as the backend and a **modern JavaScript frontend** (React, Vite, or Next.js).  
Both parts must work together seamlessly.

The backend will expose RESTful endpoints.  
The frontend will consume them and implement all required features.  
Implement all features, tests, and documentation described below.

## Features and Requirements

### 🧩 User Authentication
Users must be able to:
- Sign up
- Sign in
- Sign out
- Reset their password
- Change their email
- Change their password

Authentication must use secure token or session handling aligned with an API architecture.  
Validate inputs and return clear error messages.

Each post should include text content, optional tags, and an author reference.  
Each comment should include text content and references to its author and post.  
Each like should reference the user and the liked entity (post or comment).

## 🧰 Technical Requirements

### Backend (Rails 8.0 API)
- Ruby 3.4.4 (already installed)
- Rails 8.0 in API mode
- PostgreSQL
- Active Storage for file uploads (profile and cover pictures)
- Active Job for background processing (e.g., notifications)
- JBuilder for JSON views
- Swagger for API documentation
- RSpec and FactoryBot for testing
- RuboCop for linting
- Brakeman for security scanning

The backend must expose RESTful endpoints for all features, provide pagination for lists, handle authentication/authorization, and return structured JSON responses with proper error handling.

### Frontend (React / Vite / Next.js)
- Consume all Rails API endpoints
- Implement all functional features
- Use TailwindCSS or similar for styling
- Use client-side routing
- Manage auth tokens (login, logout, session persistence)
- Include pages for feed, profiles, post details, settings, notifications, and search
- Handle loading and error states

---

## 🧪 Testing
- RSpec tests for backend models, controllers, and request specs
- FactoryBot factories for test data
- Frontend tests (Jest/Vitest) for critical user flows
- Tests for authentication, posts, comments, likes (posts and comments), reposts, and search

---

## 📘 Documentation
- Generate Swagger documentation covering all endpoints
- Include authentication details and example requests/responses
- Provide a `README.md` explaining:
  - How to run the Rails API
  - How to run the frontend
  - Required environment variables
  - How to run tests and linters
  - Deployment notes
