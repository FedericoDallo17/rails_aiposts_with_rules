# AIPosts

Welcome to AIPosts, a rails demo API built with Cursor to test its capabilities to create an app from scratch. This repo has a [ruleset](/.cursor/rules) to be applied, but another repo will be created without a ruleset to compare both results.

In the repo you will find a [prompt](PROMPT.md) and a [checklist](PROMPT_CHECKLIST.md) to be used by the agent in order to create the project.
